# CLAUDE.md — MechX

Guidance for working in this repository. MechX is an **offline native Windows
desktop Flutter app** for MEP (mechanical / electrical / plumbing) design of
Indonesian (**SNI**-standard) buildings. An engineer loads PDF floor plans,
calibrates each sheet's scale, sets per-floor heights, draws duct/pipe/fire
elements, and MechX auto-sizes everything to SNI rules, sizes pumps/fans/fire
systems, draws a schematic riser diagram, shows a live pressure heatmap, and
outputs a Bill of Materials and a calculation report — all offline.

The authoritative spec + running history is `MEP-PDF-Sizing-Tool-Build-Plan.md`
(read its **§12 guardrails** and the **§15 decisions log** at the bottom).

## Golden rules (architecture guardrails, §12)

1. **The engine is pure Dart with ZERO Flutter imports.** Everything in
   `packages/mechx_engine/lib/**` must be framework-free and runnable under
   `dart test`. Never import `package:flutter/*` there.
2. **One unit system internally: SI**, via zero-cost Dart-3 `extension type`
   typed quantities in `units.dart` (Length, Diameter, Area, Velocity,
   FlowRate, Pressure, Head, Power, Roughness…). Convert at the boundary with
   `.mm` / `.litersPerSecond` / `.kiloPascals` constructors and `.inXxx`
   getters. Don't pass bare doubles across APIs where a typed quantity fits.
3. **Geometry + floor elevations are the single source of truth for length**
   (§10): horizontal run length = pixels × per-sheet calibration; vertical
   length = a **true-elevation delta**, NEVER measured from the PDF. Node
   elevation is role-aware (`nodeElevation` in `network.dart`): a `main` sits
   at the ceiling, a `fixture` at fixture height, `plant` at a datum.
4. **Gravity / pressurized / air are SEPARATE sizing code paths** (§7), routed
   by `ServiceType.regime` in `sizing/network_sizing.dart`. Never collapse them
   into one "size a pipe" routine.
5. **The diagram, heatmap, and zoning are GENERATED RENDERS of the one solve**
   (`network/pressure_solve.dart`), not parallel calculations.
6. **Standards are pluggable data with `// VERIFY` flags.** Values not confirmed
   verbatim against an SNI document are marked `// VERIFY` and surfaced to the
   user (the calc report has a dedicated "Unverified values" section sourced
   from `SniProfile.verifyChecklist`). Keep that honesty surface intact.
7. **Versioned project file from day one.** `data/project_document.dart` writes
   a `version` header; loading is tolerant (unknown enums fall back, newer
   versions are rejected with a message). Add a migration step rather than
   breaking old `.mechx` files.
8. **Custom design system — no Material/Fluent.** The app uses `WidgetsApp`
   (not `MaterialApp`) and `MechXTheme`; all styling comes from
   `ui/theme/design_tokens.dart` (8pt grid, one type scale, light/dark).

## Build / test / verify

The dev container has the Flutter SDK but **no display and no Windows/Linux
desktop build deps**, so you can run tests and `flutter analyze` but CANNOT
`flutter run` or `flutter build`. Verify changes via the test + golden pipeline.

```bash
# Engine (pure Dart) — run FROM the engine package:
cd packages/mechx_engine && dart test          # ~334 tests

# App (Flutter) — run FROM the repo root:
flutter test                                   # ~80 tests incl. golden screenshots
flutter analyze                                 # must be clean

# Regenerate the UI golden screenshots after any visual change:
flutter test --update-goldens test/screenshots_test.dart
```

`test/screenshots_test.dart` renders the full app to PNGs in `test/goldens/`
(01 plan dark, 02 plan light, 03 heatmap, 04 schematic) using bundled Roboto
fonts at a 1440×900 surface — this is how UI is "seen" without a display. Full
app widget tests size the surface to a desktop window via
`test/test_util.dart` (`setDesktopSurface`).

**The gate (must stay green): `flutter analyze` clean + engine `dart test` +
app `flutter test`.** No change lands red.

### Watch-outs when running commands
- Bash `cwd` persists between calls. `dart test` only works inside
  `packages/mechx_engine`; `flutter test` only from the repo root. Double-check
  you're in the right directory (a stray `cd` has silently run engine tests
  when the app suite was intended).
- `flutter analyze` from inside `packages/mechx_engine` analyzes only the
  engine. Run it from the repo root to cover the app.
- Roboto lacks many symbol glyphs (→ ✓ ⚠ ↑ render as tofu). Use plain text
  ("OK"/"over"/"up") or the few that bundle (·). Goldens will catch tofu.
- Custom fonts: every on-canvas `TextStyle`/`TextSpan` must set
  `fontFamily: 'Roboto'` (or 'Roboto Mono') or it renders as boxes in goldens.

## Feature state (what's built)

PDF import (pdfrx) + multi-sheet rail; per-sheet scale calibration; per-floor
heights + role-aware elevations; draw runs/risers for 10 services (cold/hot
water, drainage, vent, rainwater, supply/return/exhaust air, sprinkler,
hydrant); **select / edit / delete / drag** nodes & edges, **multi-floor
duplicate**, ortho snap, keyboard (Delete, Esc, Ctrl+Z/Y); auto-sizing per
regime (water via accumulated UBAP→Hunter; drainage/vent via DFU capacity
tables; ducts round/rect + velocity/equal-friction; rainwater via storm
table); per-fixture types + occupancy + diffuser airflow; **upfeed-pump vs
roof-tank-downfeed** solve with unified residual heatmap; PRV pressure zoning;
pump/fan duty + motor; hot-water recirculation; fire sprinkler + standpipe;
schematic riser diagram; **BOM + fittings + CSV export**; **Markdown calc
report export**; versioned `.mechx` save/open with viewport restore;
**autosave / crash-recovery**; light/dark.

## Conventions

- **Riverpod**: `Notifier`/`NotifierProvider` for mutable state, `Provider` for
  derived values. Controllers expose intent methods; widgets `ref.watch` state
  and `ref.read(...).notifier` for actions.
- **Undo**: `NetworkController` and `ProjectController` each keep a local
  snapshot stack, but every forward mutation also records its domain on a
  **single global timeline** (`store/history_store.dart`). Ctrl/Cmd+Z (and the
  Draw-panel Undo/Redo) call `historyProvider`, which pops the timeline and
  drives the owning controller's local revert — so undo reverts the genuinely
  most-recent edit across domains. `applyDocument` resets the timeline on load.
- **Tests are the spec.** Engine seed suites hand-compute expected values from
  first principles (see the arithmetic comments) — keep that. When a formula
  changes, update the test's derivation, don't just relax tolerances. Prefer
  deriving expected values from the engine's own primitives over magic numbers
  for orchestration-level tests.
- Add-only / minimal edits; match surrounding style; never push to a branch
  other than the assigned feature branch.

## Known gaps / TODO (see decisions log for detail)

- Electrical ("E") domain — intentionally out of scope here (handled in another
  repo).
- Native PDF *drawing* export (DXF drawing export and the Markdown calc report
  are done; both convert to PDF externally).
- Multi-select / copy-paste / measurement-annotation; per-outlet roof-area UI
  for storm (rainfall intensity is tunable; roof area is a fixed default);
  user fixture libraries.
- Looped networks: ring/grid **pressurized & air** mains are now balanced with
  Hardy-Cross (`network/hardy_cross.dart`) at sizing time and the balanced flows
  feed the heatmap; the split uses planar pixel geometry under a uniform-diameter
  first pass (a full design re-balances against the sized diameters — `// VERIFY`).
  Gravity loops (drainage/vent/rainwater) still use the tree path (physical rings
  there are nonsensical).
- SNI verification debt: values carry a `VerificationStatus` tier —
  `sniVerbatim` (confirmed against the SNI text), `secondarySource` (real but
  pending the official clause), or `notAnSniClause` (deliberately general
  practice). Anything not `sniVerbatim` stays `verified == false` and MUST
  surface (with its tier) in any report. Genuine verbatim confirmation requires
  the official SNI PDF — do NOT flip a flag from a secondary source.
- App lifecycle: the root `ProviderContainer` and autosave `Timer` in `main`
  live for the whole process and are not explicitly disposed (fine for a
  single-window desktop app; revisit if multi-window).

## Sizing-engine invariants (don't regress)

- **Looped sizing (`autoSizeNetwork`)**: a component with > (nodes − 1) edges is
  looped; for pressurized/air services its flows are split with Hardy-Cross
  (`balanceFlows`, length-based resistance) instead of unique-path accumulation,
  so no ring edge wrongly carries the full load. Trees take the exact same code
  path as before. Don't route gravity loops through Hardy-Cross.
- **Network rooting (`autoSizeNetwork`)**: each service component is rooted at
  its *source* — a `plant`, else a non-fixture/non-demand entry leaf, else the
  busiest demand-free junction. The root's own demand never traverses an edge,
  so a fixture must never be chosen as root or its load vanishes. Demand is
  collected from *every* demand-bearing node (including inline degree-2
  fixtures/diffusers), not just leaves.
- **Units in reports**: typed quantities store SI base units (Pressure in Pa);
  a `StandardValue.unit` is a display label (e.g. "kPa"). Never print
  `value`+`unit` together — surface the human-readable `note`. (See
  `calc_report.dart` / `StandardValue.toString`.)
- **Persistence**: design settings (occupancy, feed, ducts, rainfall, fire
  hazard, theme) round-trip via `DesignSettings` in the `.mechx` file; autosave
  only writes recovery when the work differs from the last clean Save
  (`lastSavedSignatureProvider`), so a saved project leaves no phantom recovery.
